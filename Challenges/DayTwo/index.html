    <h1>Day 2 Challenge</h1>
    <p>
            Create a Dog class. Each dog should have a name and a location.
            Add a speak method that logs "Woof! my name is {name}"
            Add a walk method that accepts two arguments: location (string) and distance (integer)
            Add a display_walks method that console.logs all of the dog's walks
            Add a total_distance method that returns the total distance of all the walks
            Research: what's the difference between console.log and return? Make sure you have a solid understanding
