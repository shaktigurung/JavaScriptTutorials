   <h1>Journal</h1>
   <h3>Challenge 1</h3>
   <p>
    Make a terminal script that will create a journal with a short-term memory. Weird, I know.
    Prompt a user for any content. What they did yesterday, what their favourite colour is, whatever. Store the user input in an array.
    Print out all entries in the array.
    Loop back and prompt the user for the next journal entry.
    The journal can only contain a maximum of 5 entries, but can loop forever.
    </p>
    <h3>Challenge 2</h3>
    <p>
        Atomic Blonde Number:
        a number is an atomic blonde number if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
        For example, 123 is an atomic blonde number, as the sum of its digits (1+2+3) is 6, which is equal to the product of its digits (1*2*3).
        Write a program to check if a number is an atomic blonde number or not. 
    </p> 

    <h3>Challenge 3</h3>   
    <p>   
        
        Pick any four digit number and do the following:
        Rearrange the string of digits to form the largest and smallest 4-digit numbers possible.
        Take these two numbers and subtract the smaller number from the larger. 
        Suppose we choose the number 8082.
        8820−0288=8532
        8532−2358=6174
        7641−1467=6174 
        It hits 6174 and then stops.
        Count also how many iterations loops are required to get to this point.
        Bonus points for recognising what 6174 is.

    <h1>Morning Challenge</h1>

        1. Implement topWatchlistedMoviesAmongFriends method that will return an array of top four movie titles, that have been most watchlisted by friends of a given user.
        2. If there are no such movies, then an empty list should be returned or as many movies as possible.
        3. Movies that have equal watchlist count, should be ordered alphabetically.
        let movies = [{
            "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
            "duration": "PT142M",
            "actors": [ "Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton" ],
            "ratings": [],
            "watchlist": [15291, 51417, 62289, 6146, 71389, 93707]
          },
          {
            "title": "The Godfather",
            "duration": "PT175M",
            "actors": [ "Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan" ],
            "ratings": [],
            "watchlist": [62289, 66380, 34139, 6146]
          },
          {
            "title": "The Dark Knight",
            "duration": "PT152M",
            "actors": [ "Christian Bale", "Heath Ledger", "Aaron Eckhart" ],
            "ratings": [],
            "watchlist": [51417, 62289, 6146, 71389, 7001]
          },
          {
            "title": "Pulp Fiction",
            "duration": "PT154M",
            "actors": [ "John Travolta", "Uma Thurman", "Samuel L. Jackson" ],
            "ratings": [],
            "watchlist": [7001, 9250, 34139, 6146]
          },
          {
            "title": "Schindler's List",
            "duration": "PT195M",
            "actors": [
              "Liam Neeson",
              "Ralph Fiennes",
              "Ben Kingsley"
            ],
            "watchlist": [15291, 51417, 7001, 9250, 93707]
          }];
        let users = [{
                "userId": 15291,
                "email": "Constantin_Kuhlman15@yahoo.com",
                "friends": [7001, 51417, 62289]
            },
            {
                "userId": 7001,
                "email": "Keven6@gmail.com",
                "friends": [15291, 51417, 62289, 66380]
            },
            {
                "userId": 51417,
                "email": "Margaretta82@gmail.com",
                "friends": [15291, 7001, 9250]
            },
            {
                "userId": 62289,
                "email": "Marquise.Borer@hotmail.com",
                "friends": [15291, 7001]
         }];
        Your implementation should return following output for userId=62289 for example data:
        ["Schindler's List", "Pulp Fiction", "The Dark Knight", "The Shawshank Redemption"]
        In the example above, user with id 62289 has two friends: user with id=15291and with id=7001. Schindler's List is watchlisted by both users, so it will be the most watchlisted.
